## Project Summary ##

Our team is building a robo advisor to help individual investors assess potential investment performance based on their:

- Investment horizon
- Initial investment and future contributions
- Appetite for risk
- Asset selection

## Project Goal ##

Leverage the user inputs to feed our Python code to make the process as automated as possible. The user's inputs will impact the investment results which will be displayed on an investor dashboard. 

## Questions to be Answered ##

- How does a user's investment time period impact their returns? 
- How does a user's aggressive, moderate, or conservative investment approach affect long-term gains?
- Do annual contributions have a material impact the compounding of the portfolio's return?
- Does rebalancing the portfolio meaningfully improve the performance of the retirement portfolio?
